			    <h1 class="min-head1">Packing Guideline Before Shipping Barrels To Jamaica</h1>
				
				<p class="min-para1">When you pack your barrels pack and wrap items correctly. For example if you're sending personal items you need to check that liquids, like lotions are:
				
				<li class="min-list">Tighty Closed</li>
				<li class="min-list">Preferably have a screw cap</li>
				<li class="min-list">Bottle necks fastened with tape</li>
				<li class="min-list">Placed in a Ziplock bag</li><br>
				<p class="min-para1">This ensure that if there's a leak it won't affect the rest of the contents of your barrel.</p>
				</p>
				
				<p class="min-para1">Place clothing and food in their own plastic bags to further protect them from spillages. Keep food away from cleansers, hairsprays and perfumes otherwise the gases such products give off can contaminate the food and ruin the taste. If it can't be avoided separate the food from the other items by at least four inches of old blackets or towels.</p>
				
				<p class="min-para1">Items that normally need refrigeration, or would require it in Jamaica, need special preparation and shipping. Talk to us for further information. Make sure the barrels you ship are correctly labelled and correctly identify the contents. You need to highlight fragile items, bulk liquids and items that shouldn't be tipped.</p>
				
				<p class="min-para1">The barrels should be marked with the barrel count, any restriction, such as <strong>"DO NOT ROLL" OR "THIS WAY UP"</strong> and the shipper and the receiver information. When Shipping barrels to Jamaica it's important to make sure the barrel marks and labels are clear and highly visible.</p>
